Type Casting✔

The type casting is a method of converting the value of one data type to another data type. It is also known as type conversion. Python is an object-orientated language, and it uses classes to define data types. Hence, the type casting can be achieved by using constructor function of given data type class.

TYPE OF TYPECASTING

Explicit Type Conversion-The programmer must perform this task manually.

Implicit Type Conversion-By the Python program automatically.

1. Implicit Type casting
 
Implicit type conversion is performed automatically by the interpreter, without user intervention. Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn’t need any user involvement Python promotes the conversion of lower data type, for example, integer to higher data type says float to avoid data loss. This type of conversion or type casting is called UpCasting.

2. Explicit Type casting
   
In Explicit Type conversion, the user or programmer converts the data type of an object to the required data type. In Python we use predefined functions like int(), float(), str(), bool() etc to perform explicit type conversion.
